## Overview
This will be a simple chess application. The goal is to create a fully-structured application, which will help me understand how to properly structure and build a Java application using a good portion of what its extensive library has to offer.

### The challenge

Users should be:

-Play chess. That is all.

## My process
Utilize the android api to create a blank screen. This will allow me to create a grid display.

### Progress Log

#### 03/22/23
Created the both the packages and classes for the tiles on the board and the chess pieces. The tile class is actually a nested class, whose inner classes can determine whether or not the tile is occupied. There's more to it than that, but I'll add details when its not 3:34am.


### Built with

- Java
- Maven

### What I learned
Not enough.
